        <h1>Technologies for Media Overlay</h1>
        <p>
           Media Overlay is essential for many types of (Web) Publications (e.g., in accessibility or in childrenâ€™s books). EPUB relies on a subset of SMIL to achieve that; this is not available for Web Publications, because browsers do not SMIL. An alternative is to define a simple set of features for a minimal level of declarative media synchronization, and use that as a basis for Media Overlay on the Web.

            <ul>
                <li data-feature="Web Animation API">Beyond text tracks, Web pages may contain many other time-based animations with which synchronization can be useful; the <a data-featureid="webanimations">Web Animations API</a> offers the tools needed to set up these synchronization points. This may become the basis for the Media Overlay work both in terms of model and terminology, as well as possible implementation work.</li>

                <li data-feature="HTML Extensions">Media Overlay <em>may</em> require some simple extensions to HTML (e.g., additional attributes for Media Overlays). The <a data-featureid="html-extensions">HTML Extension Specifications</a> provides a good starting point for the roadmap to such extensions.</li>

            <h2>Exploratory work</h2>
            <ul>
                <li data-feature="Multi-device synchronization">There are a number of cases that need synchronization of several tracks in the same page, for instance to synchronize the sign-language transcript of an audio track with its associated video. The <code>MediaController</code> interface, initially defined in HTML5, was dropped from the HTML specification due to very limited implementation support. The <a data-featureid="timing">Timing Object</a> specification proposes a mechanism to bring shared on-line locks to browsers and ease synchronization of heterogeneous content within a single device and across devices. This may be useful for the Media Overlay work.</li>
