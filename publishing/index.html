        <h1>Roadmap of Web Applications on Mobile</h1>
        <p>
            One of the goals of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/publishing/groups/publ-wg/">Publishing Working groups</a> is to rely,as much as possible, on technologies developed elsewhere at W3C, so that the Web Publication specific technologies would become a minimal layer on the top of the existing Web, rather then giving the impression of forking it. These pages collect references to those W3C technologies that already exist and could provide the foundation of the Web Publishing work.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that Web Publishing relies on a number of technologies for the deployment of <em>content</em>, like HTML or SVG, but these are not listed in this roadmap. Web Publications consider these technologies as given, without the goal of chaning them (with the minor exception of, possibly, defining some extensions to HTML in the form of new attributes).

            This is a living document. It will evolve as work goes ahead in the Working Group; new items may be added, and items may be removed if it turns out they are irrelevant for this work.
